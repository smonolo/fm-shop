## Development

New feature flow (branches): `feature -> dev -> staging -> main`

### Branches

- `main`: Production branch
- `staging`: Staging branch
- `dev`: Development branch
- `feature`: Feature branch

Note that `feature` is not the actual name of the branch but rather just a placeholder. Branch should be named after the name of the actual feature.
